# Classification_with_Python
Building a  classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not. 

In this project, I built a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not. 
I loaded a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, applying different classification algorithm on the data:
•	k-Nearest Neighbour
•	Decision Tree
•	Support Vector Machine
•	Logistic Regression

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:
•	Jaccard index
•	F1-score
•	LogLoass
